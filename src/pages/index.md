  description: "I am a Doctoral student working on environmental philosophy.
    Philosophy is my passion and I deeply care about nature. For several years
    now I have dedicated my attention to trying to understand the human-nature
    relationship and finding ways to understand and explain how nature has value
    and obligates us. With philosophy, I enjoy how you can ask philosophical
    questions just about anything and everything. As such, philosophy is a
    powerful way to find common ground between different topics and academic
    fields. This makes philosophy an effective way to connect, unify and
    reconcile ideas, research fields and (reflection of) worlds. I also love how
    creative philosophy is; only our imagination and reason are the limit.  "

  description: "My PhD thesis titled “Degraded, Damaged, and Destroyed: A
    Conceptual Analysis of Ecological Restoration and Its Ethical Implications”
    is a philosophical analysis of ecological restoration. The first part of my
    PhD thesis is focused on conceptual analysis, trying to understand what
    ecological restoration really is and mapping any inconsistencies and
    shortcomings of the concept. The second part of my PhD is dedicated to the
    normative analysis of ecological restoration, where I explore whether
    humanity can be considered having an obligation to restore the damage it has
    caused to nature and I aim to build a normative framework for ecological
    restoration."
