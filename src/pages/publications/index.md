        This chapter considers the relationship between rights of nature and
        ecological restoration, by sketching a rights-based approach to
        restoration. It begins with a discussion of ecological restoration and
        some of the debates involved in this practice. Next, it develops an
        account of the right to restoration, including the structure, basis, and
        duties involved in this right. Finally, it examines the ethical
        implications of a rights-based approach to restoration, and argues that
        this approach has the potential to fulfil our obligations regarding the
        protection of nature.

        Climate change is a profound global-scale challenge to the
        sustainability of human society and the biosphere. This article
        introduces the key scientific research on climate change and its ethical
        implications. It begins by summarizing the key types of anthropogenic
        climate forcing agents including CO2, CH4, N2O, and air pollution
        including particulate matter (PM) and their sources. A combination of
        mitigation, restoration, and adaptation strategies currently being
        considered are introduced and compared. Global climate change intersects
        with many academic disciplines and this article attempts provide a
        holistic overview of the current observations of climate change based on
        scientific and ethical considerations. Our analysis includes the
        atmosphere and hydrosphere, and the impacts of climate 29 change on
        society. The aim is to provide a fuller account of climate change from
        perspective of disciplines not often seen together, thus providing a
        more comprehensive account of the most defining problem of our time.
